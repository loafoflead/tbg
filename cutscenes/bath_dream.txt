Your eyes are stung by the onslaught of sensations and impressions from your brain. 
You close them, and let the whirling colours and shapes overtake your mind.
When your brain finally recovers, everything seems very washed out. 
You get out of the bath. 
You rub your eyes a little. 
You realise it's not just you, the colour seemed to have actually been drained out of the world around you. 
You shudder a little.
