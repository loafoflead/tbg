You wake up suddenly. You feel a little dreamy. When you look around, it's clear that you're not in your room anymore.
You try to pinch your arm to wake up, but somehow your hand never reaches your arm, it simply stayed at the same distance away, like a {Grey}r{DarkGrey}a{Grey}i{DarkGrey}n{Grey}b{DarkGrey}o{Grey}w{White}.
You look around again, and realise the place you're in ressembles your house, just from a mirrorred perspective. Your cupboard is on the other side of the room, and so is your desk.
You wonder if there's an {DarkRed}opposite version of you{def} waiting outside the door.
