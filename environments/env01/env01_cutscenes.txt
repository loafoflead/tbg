You wake up.$
You see an opaque plastic plate in front of you, and notice the room you're in is slowly filling up with {Red}smoke{end}.
For a second, your lethargic mind doesn't process this. $$Then, you start to panic.
You frantically pound against the plastic door, {Red}smoke{end} slowly filling up the tiny cubicle you're in.
The door bends a little when you hit it, but your tired muscles prevent you from doing any more than that.
$You bash the door further, finally feeling it buckle and swing outwards. 
The {Red}smoke{end} escaped into the chamber you were now in, dissapearing into a nearby ventilation shaft high above your head.
You pause a moment,$ and begin to take account of your surroundings.
